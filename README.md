# GP-Hotel-Management-System
Develop a hotel booking system using REST API. The hotel has 10 rooms, customers need to be registered. Customers can book one room with arrival &amp; checkout time. During booking, the customer can pay the partial or full amount. Later during checkout, will pay any due amounts. Another customer cannot book the same room between the existing arrival &amp; checkout time. There should be a booking list with customer name, booked room number with arrival, checkout date time, and total paid amount.
